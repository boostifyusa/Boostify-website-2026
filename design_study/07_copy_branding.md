# Copy & Branding Guide

This document analyzes the copywriting style, voice, and branding elements used across the website. Use this guide to ensure future content feels like it was written by the same team.

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone

**Primary Tone**: Confident, Direct, and Results-Oriented.
**Secondary Brand**: "Local", "Craftsman", "Anti-Agency".

| Trait | Description | Do This | Don't Do This |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Directness** | We speak plainly and get to the point. | "Stop waiting for leads." | "We interactively facilitate optimal lead generation paradigms." |
| **Confidence** | We know we're good. We rely on data, not fluff. | "Not just talk — receipts." | "We believe we might be a good fit." |
| **Local Pride** | We are unapologetically from Fresno/Central Valley. | "Tailored for the Central Valley." | "Global digital solutions." |
| **Aggressive** | We position ourselves against "lazy" agencies. | "The old way is broken." | "We offer an alternative to traditional methods." |

### Key Vocabulary
-   **Positive**: Growth, Engine, Weapon, Dominate, ROI, Receipts, Craftsman, Speed, Security, "No Fluff".
-   **Negative (The Enemy)**: Bloat, Templates, "Burning Money", "Lazy Agencies", "Cookie-cutter".

## 2. Copy Structure Patterns

### The "Problem-Agitation-Solution" (PAS) Framework
Most sections follow this strict psychological pattern:
1.  **Problem**: Identify a pain point (e.g., losing money on ads).
2.  **Agitation**: Twist the knife (e.g., "You're paying for clicks that never convert.").
3.  **Solution**: Present Boostify as the specific cure (e.g., "Laser-focused campaigns that target...").

**Example from Local Marketing Page:**
> **Headline**: "You're Burning Money on Bad Ads!" (Problem)
> **Body**: "Most small businesses waste thousands... paying for clicks that never become customers." (Agitation)
> **Solution**: "We build laser-focused campaigns..." (Solution)

### The "Receipts" Pattern
Never make a claim without backing it up immediately with a metric or a guarantee.
-   *Claim*: "We move fast."
-   *Proof*: "Most projects launch in weeks, not months."
-   *Claim*: "We treat your budget like our own."
-   *Proof*: "60-Day Money-Back Guarantee."

### Headline Style
Headlines are almost always short, punchy, and often use **bolding** for emphasis on the final words.
-   "Digital Craftsmanship for **Local Growth**"
-   "Stop Waiting for Leads. Start Getting Them **Today**."
-   "Your Idea. Built & Launched in **Weeks**."

## 3. Formatting Rules
-   **Bolding**: Use bold text **sparingly** within paragraphs to highlight the most important benefit.
-   **Short Paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max. Large blocks of text are banned.
-   **Icons over Bullets**: Lists are almost always accompanied by icons (Checkmarks, Zaps, Shields) rather than simple bullet points.

## 4. Brand Positioning
**Mission**: To give local businesses the same digital firepower as big tech companies, without the agency bloat.
**Enemy**: "Template factories" (Wix/SquareSpace/Cheap Agencies) and "Overpriced Agencies" (who charge $50k for an MVP).
**Hero**: The Local Business Owner (who deserves better).

## 5. UI/Microcopy Guidelines
-   **Buttons**: Action-oriented verbs.
    -   *Good*: "Start Your Project", "Get Your Free Audit", "Book a Call".
    -   *Bad*: "Submit", "Contact Us", "Learn More".
-   **Badges**: Small, pill-shaped tags used to categorize or hype content.
    -   *Style*: Uppercase, tracking-widest, bold.
    -   *Examples*: "OUR PROCESS", "MEET THE FOUNDER", "GOOGLE GUARANTEED".
