# Boostify Design System Study

This folder contains a comprehensive breakdown of the design system used in the Boostify website. It is intended as a reference to recreate or extend the design without altering the existing site.

## Documentation Index

1.  [**Colors & Theme**](./01_colors_theme.md) - Hex codes, gradients, and shadow effects.
2.  [**Typography**](./02_typography.md) - Fonts, weights, sizes, and tracking.
3.  [**Components Catalog**](./03_components.md) - Reusable UI elements like buttons, cards, and navbars.
4.  [**Graphics & Assets**](./04_graphics_assets.md) - How to recreate visual effects (orbs, patterns) and asset usage.
5.  [**Complex Graphics (Mocks)**](./06_complex_graphics.md) - Code-based mocks for PageSpeed, Browser frames, and Dashboards.
6.  [**Layout & Structure**](./05_layout_structure.md) - Spacing, grids, and container max-widths.
7.  [**Copy & Branding Guide**](./07_copy_branding.md) - Voice, tone, and copywriting patterns (PAS, vocabulary).

## Key Takeaways
- **No Images for UI**: Most "graphics" (like the glowing orbs or browser windows) are created with **CSS/Tailwind**, not images.
- **Lucide Icons**: Used for all iconography.
- **Inter Font**: The only font family used, but with varied weights and tight tracking for style.
